# baileyEMS
This repository ("baileyEMS") is where I (Joe Bailey) developed a node.js application using JavaScript for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with Node.js and databases in general by demonstrating the ability to create a working application that utilized databases and server setup. This application had the most indepth directions to date and required multiple different files working cohesively.


## Installation

The applicaiton is deployed using github. The files can be opened in terminal. Afterwards, the user needs to run a npm install inorder to install the dependencies. Running the server should then run the startApp() function. 

## User Story
**As an** employee manager\
**I want** to create employees in different roles and departments
**So that** I have quick access to all of my employees and their individual roles and salaries. 

## Credits

I was the main creator of the main application and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver. I also used YouTube to find different videos on JavaScript, Node.js, express routes,and various troubleshooting tips.
